# Imgpx

The simplest example would be to take an optimized image file from an external URL that points to the original image (without the URL protocol):

```text
GET https://cdn.staticaly.com/img/:REMOTE_IMAGE_URL
```

This service supports several URL parameters to manipulate the image output. Example:

```text
GET https://cdn.staticaly.com/img/:REMOTE_IMAGE_URL?w=72&h=72
```
